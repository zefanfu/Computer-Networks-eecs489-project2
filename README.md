# Computer-Networks-eecs489-project2

This is the project 2 of Computer Networks course.

Video traffic dominates the Internet. In this project, I explore how video content distribution networks (CDNs) work. In particular, I implement adaptive bitrate selection, DNS load balancing, and an HTTP proxy server to stream video at high bit rates from the closest server to a given client.
